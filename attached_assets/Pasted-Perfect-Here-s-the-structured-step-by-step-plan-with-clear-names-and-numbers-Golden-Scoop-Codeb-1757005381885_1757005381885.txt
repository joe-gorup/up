Perfect! Here's the structured step-by-step plan with clear names and numbers:

Golden Scoop Codebase Optimization Plan
Phase 1: Code Cleanup & Deprecation
Step 1: Legacy Shift System Audit

Identify all shift-related code, components, and database tables
Determine what can be safely removed vs. what needs migration
Step 2: Dead Code Detection

Scan for unused React components and functions
Find orphaned database queries and API endpoints
Identify unreferenced TypeScript interfaces
Step 3: Duplicate Code Consolidation

Compare overlapping functionality between shift and assessment workflows
Identify UI patterns that can be merged
Find redundant state management
Step 4: Dependency Cleanup

Audit npm packages for unused dependencies
Check for security vulnerabilities in outdated packages
Identify lighter alternatives for heavy packages
Phase 2: Performance Analysis
Step 5: Database Query Performance

Analyze slow queries and missing indexes
Check for N+1 query problems
Review connection pooling efficiency
Step 6: Database Structure Review

Evaluate JSONB field usage efficiency
Check data normalization opportunities
Review data types and constraints
Step 7: Frontend Bundle Analysis

Measure JavaScript bundle size
Identify code splitting opportunities
Find unused CSS and components
Step 8: Runtime Performance Check

Evaluate React re-render patterns
Check for memory leaks
Review API call efficiency
Phase 3: Stability & Security
Step 9: Error Handling Audit

Review error boundaries and fallback UI
Check API error handling completeness
Test offline/connection scenarios
Step 10: Security Assessment

Review authentication security
Check for injection vulnerabilities
Evaluate permission enforcement
Phase 4: Cost Optimization
Step 11: Database Cost Analysis

Review storage usage and growth patterns
Evaluate archiving strategies
Check connection efficiency
Step 12: Hosting Resource Review

Monitor memory/CPU usage
Assess auto-scaling needs
Review static asset delivery
Which step would you like to start with? I recommend Step 1: Legacy Shift System Audit since removing unused code will make the subsequent steps more effective.
